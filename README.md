## vim-etlua

Vim Syntax highlighting for [etlua](https://github.com/leafo/etlua) templates.

This will highlight HTML and embedded lua.

#### DISCLAIMER

I really don't know what I'm doing with vimscript, and the syntax file is a bit messy. But it works, so I'm happy with it. If you have any feedback feel free to create an issue, or PR/Fork as desired.
